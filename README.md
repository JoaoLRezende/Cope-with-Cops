Your goal is to survive as long as you can. To do that, you'll have to trick the cops into crashing into other cars.

Playing instructions:
1. Maximize your terminal window. (Most importantly, make it at least 43 rows high.)
2. Run ```runghc main.hs```. (Compiling the game with `ghc` causes it to lose its explosion effects. I don't know why.)
3. Use the A and D keys to move.

TODO
------------

- ask user to resize their terminal window before starting the game.
    "Please resize your terminal window to 80x43. (Current size: mxn.)"
    "Done! Press any button to start." (And show playing instructions below.)

- allow controlling the car with the arrow keys.

- add sounds?
